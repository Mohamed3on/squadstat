          worth — green is the good outcome from either end, under value on the way in and over it
          on the way out. <strong>Overall</strong> is value added minus money spent, everything
          netted — a club can come out ahead while getting weaker if the market paid it enough on
          the way. Loans count towards <strong>Squad value</strong>, where a player on loan is in
          the dressing room either way, and a loan fee counts as cash in <strong>Net</strong>. What
          they stay out of is <strong>Bought</strong> and <strong>Sold</strong>: TM publishes a fee
          for few loans, and neither a €3m loan fee nor no fee at all is what a €25m player was
          worth. A club keeps its whole window under any league filter; open a row for the deals
          behind it.
