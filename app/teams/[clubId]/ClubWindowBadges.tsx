/**
 * What this club's window came to, and any club table it heads.
 *
 * Every club that did business among the season's biggest transfers gets the
 * standing figure — value in minus value out, which is the one number that says
 * whether a window strengthened a squad rather than merely churned it. The six
 * table ends each badge whichever club leads them on top of that.
 *
 * A club leading the squad-value table would then print its net value twice, so
 * that accolade absorbs the standing figure instead of sitting beside a copy of
 * it. Nothing renders at all for a club with no deals in the top 400 — a
 * handful of the big five, and most clubs below them.
 *
 * Same shape as `PlayerTransferBadges`: own fetch, own `<Suspense>`, failure
 * swallowed rather than taken out on the page around it.
