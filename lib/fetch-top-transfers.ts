/**
 * Transfermarkt's "Top transfers of the season" table — the N most expensive
 * moves of one season, each with the player's market value at the time and the
 * fee actually paid.
 *
 * `plus/1` is the wide variant of the view: it adds the "Left" club column the
 * default `plus/0` omits, at no extra request cost.
 *
 * TM paginates this at 25 rows/page. Unlike the einnahmenausgaben endpoint (see
 * scripts/scrape-transfer-balance.ts), this one serves concurrent requests
 * happily, so every page goes at once through fetchPage's pool. Measured over
 * the 8 pages a top-200 fetch took: 2.1s all-at-once against 2.2s for a single
 * page — the whole thing costs what one request costs. (At concurrency 4 it was
 * 4.1s, at 2 it was 7.8s, so the pool's default of 10 is doing the work.) The 16
 * pages this now takes overflow the pool into a second round: 3.4s against 1.9s
 * for 10, once a day behind the cache. TM does answer 503 to the odd page under
 * that load; fetchPage retries with backoff.
